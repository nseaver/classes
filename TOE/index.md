## Overview  

This course is a workshop in the anthropology of technology, focused on devices designed for psychological goals.

on a particular kind of technology—what the anthropologist Alfred Gell called *technologies of enchantment*. Unlike stereotypical technologies that work on physical material, technologies of enchantment are designed with *psychological* goals. These technologies are complex, and they are much older than they seem. Under Gell's umbrella, we can include not only contemporary "tech" like social media algorithms or generative AI, but also apparently simple objects like mousetraps or imposing entryway doors.

The course surveys a broad range of such technical practices, from fishing to phishing, as well as anthropological approaches to studying them. What distinguishes the anthropological approach from others you might encounter in other courses is an abiding interest in locating these technologies in social and cultural contexts: that is, technologies of enchantment are made by people in particular social positions, under particular interpretive frameworks for making sense of the world. We will also be relentlessly comparative, making sense of these technologies by bringing together diverse examples to explore their similarities and differences. "Technology" will take on a very broad meaning in this class, referring not only to physical artifacts, but also to a way of analyzing works of art, advertising, plans, scams, and magic tricks.

We'll begin with an extended foray into the anthropology of traps and trapping, where humans devise devices that work on the minds of animal prey; then, we will broaden our scope to think of other kinds of practices and objects as trap-like. In the second half of the course, we turn to digital technologies—examining how designers, marketers, and platforms use interfaces, algorithms, and deceptive patterns to capture and hold attention.

## Learning Objectives  

The work in the course is designed to help you learn a few things:
1.  To locate texts, facts, and artifacts in broader social and cultural contexts, thinking critically and generously about concepts, canons, and taken-for-granted categories.
2.  To develop a command of a specialized area in the academic literature, following your own intellectual instincts.
3.  To develop critical reading and writing skills, including the ability to analyze scholarly arguments and to make your own.

## Assignments  

This is the basic break-down of work you’ll have to complete in this class, along with deadlines and how much of your grade they count for. You can find more detailed descriptions of assignments, along with grading specifications, on the Canvas assignment pages, where you will also be submitting your work.

### Reading  

Each class meeting has one or two assigned readings—book chapters or journal articles—which you should complete before we meet. If a text is not readily available online, I've put a PDF of it in our class files on Canvas. If it is available online, I’ve linked it here, and you should download it yourself using our library resources. If you can’t get something, let me know so I can help you (and your classmates) out.

While reading, look for main arguments, interesting passages, connections to other readings, or points of confusion. Minimally, you should be prepared to answer the question "What's one thing you found interesting about this text?" for every reading, for every class meeting. I expect that you’ll have the texts with you and be ready to refer to specific passages in them to support your claims and motivate your questions. You should do the readings with your own intelligence, not an artificial one.

> ### Reading encouragement program (up to 10%) 
> It is very important to the functioning of this class that you read. If it turns out that people are having trouble finding the motivation to read, and this begins to impact class discussions, I will implement a *reading encouragement program*. This will either require short reading responses to each assigned text or collaborative annotation of the texts using an online tool. Points will come from the attendance part of the grade, adjusted for how far into the term we are.

### Trap Analysis (15%)  

Following our day on operatory chains, you will choose a trap and analyze it, producing an operatory chain diagram and a short research memo about it.

### Trap Design (25%)  

Culminating the first half of the class, you will, in groups, design and prototype a trap of your own to catch some kind of prey. This can be as literal or figurative as you like (informed by class materials, of course), and it will be accompanied by a report analyzing it according to class themes. We will have some time in class to work on these together and to present them.

### Interface Analysis (15%)  

Following our day on the walkthrough method, you will choose a digital interface of some sort to analyze, examining the techniques it uses to influence and retain users.

### Final Project (25%)



### Attendance (20%)  

You can miss two class meetings without penalty, and make up four more absences with some extra work. See details in the [policies](#policies) section below.

## Policies

### Attendance

This course depends on active participation, which means that I expect you to show up, speak up, and listen up. You should treat each other with respect and patience, and you should engage the readings constructively. If something isn't working for you or is hampering your ability to participate fully, you should let me know as soon as you can so we can try to fix it. If you are averse to speaking out in class, you will have chances to participate in smaller group discussions, and I suggest that you prepare potential contributions ahead of class time, so you don't have to come up with them on the spot.

You can miss two classes without penalty, no explanation needed. (Presentation days are mandatory, though.) Beyond that, you can make up four more absences by completing a make-up assignment: find a source referenced in a class reading that intrigues you, read it, and write a one-page précis of it that relates it to course concepts. (For our purposes, a précis is a motivated summary: not just a catalog of topics in the reading, but a short account of what you found interesting and how it connects to the class.) By default, these are due to me via email within a week of your absence, but in extreme situations, we can make alternate arrangements. After six total absences, no more can be made up, and you should consider whether you are still able to participate fully in the course. This policy starts the very first day of class, whether or not you are enrolled at the time.

### Grading

The two analysis assignments are graded pass/fail: if you meet all the specifications listed in the assignment on Canvas, you'll get full credit. If you do not meet the specs, you won't get credit, but you'll have one chance to revise, with comments from me. The idea behind this is that these assignments are for practice, and it's more important that you complete them than that you do a great job.

The two large projects will get conventional letter grades, based both on whether your work meets the specs and the quality of that work. Components of those projects may be graded differently (with some parts being pass/fail and others being letter graded). For any group work, I assign a letter grade for the whole group; based on peer evaluations, I may adjust individual letter grades up or down a step. Extreme cases may result in more substantial adjustments.

Because it is relatively easy to get full credit just for completing all the work in the class, I don't automatically give A+ grades at any particular threshold. I reserve the A+ for students who have both earned a high A and demonstrate exceptional effort and achievement in the class.

### Late Work

I am often flexible about deadlines, especially if you get in touch with me before they pass. I don't auto-deduct points based on how late an assignment is, but assignments turned in too late with no prior consultation may not get any credit. The general rule is that you should talk to me if you need flexibility; I don't want to make your life or mine harder for arbitrary reasons.

### Accessibility

I want you to succeed in this class. If anything is affecting your ability to participate—course structure, health, family, friends, enemies—please let me know. The sooner I learn about issues, the sooner we can work out a solution together. Any conversation we have about such issues will stay confidential.

You don't need to [register with the StAAR Center](https://students.tufts.edu/staar-center/accessibility-services/register-accommodations) or have a documented disability to request accommodations from me. However, you may find the support they offer useful, and I encourage you to get in touch with them.

### Availability

Email is the best way to reach me. Expect a reply within a day or two; if you don't hear back, please nudge me. I try to stay off of email evenings and weekends.

I hold office hours several days a week, with [online signups](https://calendly.com/nick-seaver/office-hours) to make sure there is enough time for everyone who wants it. Office hours are not just for emergencies or problems; they are open time I set aside for students. You can sign up for a slot to talk about class, your academic program in general, or whatever else you're interested in. Make use of this time as often as you like.

### Academic Integrity and AI

Do your own work. If you don't, then you won't learn, and there's no point in being here. Academic integrity issues usually happen when students get overwhelmed and panic. If that's happening to you, talk to me before you do something regrettable.

Plagiarism policies usually tell you what not to do: don't buy papers, don't copy without citing, don't pass off AI-generated text as your own. Don't do any of that, of course, but I want you to think more expansively about what the point of academic integrity is: it is not to produce wholly "original" writing, which does not exist (whatever Turnitin may claim). Human communication is always made up of things we didn't come up with ourselves, at scales ranging from letters and words to concepts and arguments. The point is to combine these materials in meaningful ways that engage with other people. Different communities have different norms about how this should be done: comedians, programmers, physicists, and poets all follow distinct rules about copying and crediting. Rather than worrying about originality, you should think about how you're relating to ideas that came from outside your head. Who are you thinking with? Where do they come from? How does their position shape their ideas, and how might yours?

In this class, we'll follow the standard academic norms of the social sciences, which hold that you should cite your sources when you borrow text, claims, or arguments. There are not yet well-established norms around the use of generative AI, but these are mine: Do not submit AI-generated text as your own writing. What's the point of that? For other aspects of work in class, you may find engaging with AI useful, but keep in mind that you are ultimately responsible for the claims you make and the company you keep. Any variations from this basic policy will be indicated in assignment specifications.

I do not use plagiarism or AI detection systems like Turnitin because I don't trust them and I don't like how they make money off of encouraging a hostile relationship between students and faculty. That being said, if I become aware of violations of the [Tufts Academic Integrity Policy](https://students.tufts.edu/community-standards/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-overview), I am required to report them to the university, and consequences can be severe. I will not spend much effort on detective work—you mostly harm yourself with this sort of thing—but if I catch it, you will find the limits of my flexibility.

### The Syllabus Is a Living Document

Everything in this syllabus is subject to revision. Any changes will be discussed in class, and I won't impose them unilaterally unless something serious happens. This page is always the current, authoritative version.

#### Version 2.0
