## Overview  

This course is a workshop in the anthropology of technology, focused on devices designed for psychological goals.

on a particular kind of technology—what the anthropologist Alfred Gell called *technologies of enchantment*. Unlike stereotypical technologies that work on physical material, technologies of enchantment are designed with *psychological* goals. These technologies are complex, and they are much older than they seem. Under Gell's umbrella, we can include not only contemporary "tech" like social media algorithms or generative AI, but also apparently simple objects like mousetraps or imposing entryway doors.

The course surveys a broad range of such technical practices, from fishing to phishing, as well as anthropological approaches to studying them. What distinguishes the anthropological approach from others you might encounter in other courses is an abiding interest in locating these technologies in social and cultural contexts: that is, technologies of enchantment are made by people in particular social positions, under particular interpretive frameworks for making sense of the world. We will also be relentlessly comparative, making sense of these technologies by bringing together diverse examples to explore their similarities and differences. "Technology" will take on a very broad meaning in this class, referring not only to physical artifacts, but also to a way of analyzing works of art, advertising, plans, scams, and magic tricks.

We'll begin with an extended foray into the anthropology of traps and trapping, where humans devise devices that work on the minds of animal prey; then, we will broaden our scope to think of other kinds of practices and objects as trap-like. In the second half of the course, we turn to digital technologies—examining how designers, marketers, and platforms use interfaces, algorithms, and deceptive patterns to capture and hold attention.

## Learning Objectives  

The work in the course is designed to help you learn a few things:
1. To locate texts, facts, and artifacts in broader social and cultural contexts, thinking critically and generously about concepts, canons, and taken-for-granted categories.
2. To develop a command of a specialized area in the academic literature, following your own intellectual instincts.
3. To develop critical reading and writing skills, including the ability to analyze scholarly arguments and to make your own.

## Assignments  

This is the basic break-down of work you’ll have to complete in this class, along with deadlines and how much of your grade they count for. You can find more detailed descriptions of assignments, along with grading specifications, on the Canvas assignment pages, where you will also be submitting your work.

### Reading  

Each class meeting has one or two assigned readings—book chapters or journal articles—which you should complete before we meet. If a text is not readily available online, I've put a PDF of it in our class files on Canvas. If it is available online, I’ve linked it here, and you should download it yourself using our library resources. If you can’t get something, let me know so I can help you (and your classmates) out.

While reading, look for main arguments, interesting passages, connections to other readings, or points of confusion. Minimally, you should be prepared to answer the question "What's one thing you found interesting about this text?" for every reading, for every class meeting. I expect that you’ll have the texts with you and be ready to refer to specific passages in them to support your claims and motivate your questions. You should do the readings with your own intelligence, not an artificial one.

> ### Reading encouragement program (up to 10%) 
> It is very important to the functioning of this class that you read. If it turns out that people are having trouble finding the motivation to read, and this begins to impact class discussions, I will implement a *reading encouragement program*. This will either require short reading responses to each assigned text or collaborative annotation of the texts using an online tool. Points will come from the attendance part of the grade, adjusted for how far into the term we are.

### Trap Analysis (15%)  

Following our day on operatory chains, you will choose a trap and analyze it, producing an operatory chain diagram and a short research memo about it.

### Trap Design (25%)  

Culminating the first half of the class, you will, in groups, design and prototype a trap of your own to catch some kind of prey. This can be as literal or figurative as you like (informed by class materials, of course), and it will be accompanied by a report analyzing it according to class themes. We will have some time in class to work on these together and to present them.

### Interface Analysis (15%)  

Following our day on the walkthrough method, you will choose a digital interface of some sort to analyze, examining the techniques it uses to influence and retain users.

### Final Project (25%)

### Attendance (20%)  

You can miss two class meetings without penalty, and make up four more absences with some extra work. See details in the [policies](#policies) section below.

## Policies  

### Grading

###### Specifications

Most assignments in this class will be graded pass/fail, according to whether you meet the requirements laid out in the assignment description. If you do not meet the requirements, you will usually have one chance to make a revision, following comments from me. This is called specifications grading, or "specs grading," and I've been using it across my classes for the past few years with some success. The philosophy behind it is that grades reward you for completing the work, not for achieving excellence. The point of most of the assignments in this class is not to be great, but to practice—and practicing is easier and more effective without the burden of performance. Details about revision timelines and specifications can be found in the assignment descriptions. If you have any uncertainty about the specifications for an assignment, please let me know ASAP, so I can clarify.

You can think of the threshold for full credit as something like a B/B+ under typical grading, but as you'll see, the comparison to letter grades isn't always meaningful: Say you complete an assignment very well, but are missing one aspect of the specs—under a letter grade system, I might let it slide and just dock some points, but under specs grading you will have a 0 until you revise and fix the issue.

The exceptions to this policy are the two larger assignments: the trap design and the final collection. These will be given conventional letter grades, as they should demonstrate what you've already had a chance to practice during class.

###### Letter grades

I use conventional percentage-to-letter conversions for your final grade; you can see what letter grade you'll get in the class on Canvas (and it will already reflect any rounding up that may be applied). I do not automatically give A+ grades based on percentages; since the difference between A and A+ does not affect your GPA, I reserve the A+ for students who've earned the A and demonstrate exceptional effort and achievement in the class.

### Conduct  
I have a few ground rules for participation in this course:
- Treat each other with respect and patience.
- Avoid destructive critique of the readings.
- Participate actively. This course only works if you do.
- Communicate. Let me know when you're struggling or if something isn't working for you, as it happens.

### Attendance  
I do not like having attendance grades in my courses because I do not want to penalize students who have to miss class for any of the myriad reasons that can come up during the semester. However, this course has been designed around active collaboration during meeting times, and missing them means missing a substantial component of the class. I have experimented with eliminating attendance policies over the years, and I've learned that, for some students, extreme flexibility means that absences pile up until they have a hard time getting back into the class; this harms their work and deprives the rest of the class of their contributions. So, I'm using an attendance policy this semester that tries to balance those concerns:
- **You can miss two course meetings, no explanation needed.** (Do not email me to explain yourself, feel bad about it, or whatever.) This policy does not apply to presentation days, where attendance is mandatory.
- Beyond those two, **every other absence has to be made up with a supplementary assignment**, which is due within a week of your absence. There are no exceptions to this policy unless you arrange something with me *in advance*.
    - The makeup assignment: Find a source cited in one of the class readings that interests you, read it, and write up a one-page précis summarizing it and describing what you find useful or interesting in it.
    - The reason for the one-week deadline is that I want you to stay engaged with the course continuously during the term, even if you have to miss a meeting. If you have to miss class due to being very ill, getting back on top of things in one week may be hard. Let me know, and I can extend this deadline by a week, in certain conditions.
  - You can make up four absences in this way. At that point, you'll have missed six of our class meetings, and you should consider whether you actually are able to fully participate in the course. After four make-ups, further absences will affect your grade and cannot be made up.
  - This policy begins the very first day of class—so if you join late, you'll be using up permitted absences.

### Accessibility  
Your success in this class is important to me. If there are any circumstances (personal, health-related, family-related, etc.) that may affect your ability to participate, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can work together to make accommodations for you. The sooner I know about any issues, the better. Any such discussion will remain confidential.

You do not need to [register with the StAAR Center](https://students.tufts.edu/staar-center/accessibility-services/register-accommodations) or have a documented disability to request accommodations from me. However, you may find the support they offer useful, and I encourage you to get in touch with them.

### Availability  
I try to be a responsive emailer; you should expect a reply within 24–48 weekday hours of emailing me. (Please don't use the Canvas inbox thing to message me.) If you don't get a reply in that window, you should feel free to follow up with me as your message may have gotten buried in my inbox. I generally don't answer emails over the weekend or after 5pm.

I hold regular office hours to meet with students. I use an [online sign-up sheet](https://calendly.com/nick-seaver/office-hours) to make sure that there's enough time for everyone who wants it and to spread you out through the hour. This time is reserved for you, and you should feel free to use it to talk to me about anything: the course, your academic program in general, or whatever you're interested in. You don't need to have a specific problem to sign up, and I enjoy talking with you outside the classroom, so feel free to make use of office hours as often as you like.

### Late work  
I am generally very flexible around deadlines, guided by a few principles: I do not want to make your life hard for no reason; I value my own time as well as yours; and extensions are not necessarily in your best interest. In general, if you get in touch with me *before* a deadline, we can work something out that balances your needs with mine and does not inadvertently make your life harder later on. I don't automatically deduct points for late work (though in some cases, especially for small assignments, I will simply not accept late work).

No matter what, if you find yourself in a situation that requires flexibility, you should let me know and we will work out something that works for both of us. (I am, as a rule, very accommodating, but extra flexibility is something for unexpected issues—not common inconveniences like having work in other classes.)

### Academic Integrity  
This course, like all your other courses, is predicated on the idea that it's you who's doing the work. If you don't do your own work, then you don't learn, and there's no point in your being enrolled in the class. Most academic integrity issues arise when students get overburdened with work and panic—if you start to find yourself being overburdened, please talk with me so we can find better ways to manage things.

Plagiarism policies tend to focus on the less productive side of this issue, urging students to be "original" and telling them what not to do (buying papers, copying uncited text from other sources or using AI to generate text and passing it off as your own). Don't do any of that, of course, but I encourage you to take a more expansive view of what academic integrity means: Our expressions are not our own. Humans communicate with words and concepts—and within cultures and discourses—that are not of our own making. Communication is a matter of combining existing materials in meaningful ways. Different groups of people have different norms that govern these combinations: blues musicians, attorneys, programmers, poets, and physicists all abide by different sets of rules about what counts as "originality," what kinds of copying and crediting are acceptable, and how one should relate to the materials from which one draws. In light of this, I do not use plagiarism (or AI) detection services like Turnitin (which, incidentally, make money by appropriating your work and encourage a hostile relationship between students and faculty). Rather than expending your energy worrying about originality, I suggest that you think instead about what kind of citational network you are locating yourself in. What thinkers are you thinking with? Where do they come from? How might their positions in the world inform their thoughts? What is your position relative to them? How might you re-shape your citational network to better reflect your priorities or ideals?

In this course, you'll continue to learn the norms of citation and attribution shared by the community of scholars in the social sciences. Failure to abide by these norms is considered plagiarism, as laid out in the [Tufts Academic Integrity Policy](https://students.tufts.edu/community-standards/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-overview), which you should familiarize yourself with. I am required to report suspected violations of this policy to the Dean of Student Affairs, and consequences can be severe. I will not spend much effort on detective work—you mostly harm yourself with this sort of thing—but if I catch it, you will find the limits of my flexibility.

### The Syllabus Is a Living Document  
Everything in the plan laid out in this syllabus is subject to revision. Any changes will be discussed in class, and I won't impose them unilaterally unless a serious issue emerges. Please let me know if you run into (or anticipate) any trouble with the plan here, so we can fix it. The current version of the syllabus will always be linked from our Canvas site.

This is version 2.0.
